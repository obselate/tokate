# Tokate

**toh-KAH-teh**. Put your spare AI usage to work for open source.

An owner approves an issue. A donor runs it with their own accounts and tools.
Tokate verifies the result and opens a draft PR for owner review.

## Install

```sh
curl -qfsSL https://tokate.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Open a new terminal if prompted. Use `tokate update` to update or `tokate uninstall`
to remove the installation while keeping saved work.

Requires **Linux x86_64 with glibc 2.34+ or Alpine 3.24, and public GitHub repositories**.
Windows, macOS and ARM64 are not supported. See [Nix](docs/nix.md) and
[Alpine](docs/alpine.md) for distribution setup. Managed donations use
native Codex with a ChatGPT login, native Claude Code with a personal Pro/Max login,
or Pi with a configured local model endpoint.
Owners need neither harness nor an AI subscription.
