# Donate work

Use your own GitHub account and coding harness. Tokate needs Linux x86_64,
glibc 2.34+, Git, the GitHub CLI and bubblewrap with working user namespaces.
Project build tools must be accessible from system paths. Keep managed runs and
harness installations outside `/tmp`.

```sh
gh auth login
```

Choose an approved, available issue. If access is required, request it and wait
for the owner to grant it:

```sh
tokate access --repo OWNER/REPO --operation request --issue 42 --scope trust
```

## Choose a tool

For Codex, use a current native installation with your ChatGPT login:

```sh
codex login
tokate doctor --managed --auth
tokate defaults set --model MODEL --effort EFFORT
tokate select --repo OWNER/REPO
```

Select an owner-allowed model and effort. The offline catalog and login check do
not prove account availability or remaining allowance. `defaults list` shows saved
choices. Add `--profile NAME` to keep several choices and select one per donation.
Profiles store neither budgets nor network consent.

### Local inference with Pi

Install current Pi and Node using [Pi's official instructions](https://pi.dev/).
Configure the model in Pi and start a no-auth HTTP loopback Chat Completions endpoint.
Tokate does not install a harness or start a model server. The owner must allow
`pi/local-chat-completions` and your exact model and reasoning level. The guided CLI
offers levels from Pi. Use `absent` only for a model without reasoning.

```sh
tokate defaults set --profile local --harness pi --model 'MODEL_ID' \
  --effort high --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
tokate select --repo OWNER/REPO --profile local
```

Tokate discovers the SDK and Node from supported npm or managed Pi installations.
For a custom layout, supply absolute `--pi-root` and `--node` paths. There is no
`/usr/bin/node` requirement. Pi's nonsecret SDK metadata must supply the configured
context and output limits. The endpoint must advertise the exact model at
`/v1/models`. Missing or incompatible metadata stops before inference. Remote
endpoints, authentication and paid Pi providers are not supported by this route.

## Claim, work and submit

In a terminal, start with `tokate work OWNER/REPO`. Choose an available approved
issue, tool and budget. Review the task, model and network permissions before confirming.

To reserve without starting inference, for example for one hour with 20 minutes
reserved for verification:

```sh
tokate claim https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/42 --profile local \
  --seconds 3600 --verification-reserve 1200
```

Omit `--profile local` to use your default tool choice. Claiming spends no inference.
Tokate posts the request and prints the saved run directory. A pending request is
not a reservation. Wait for coordinator acceptance, then run:

```sh
tokate work --run RUN_DIRECTORY
tokate submit --run RUN_DIRECTORY
```

`work` spends the selected budget and independently verifies completed work.
`submit` requests the draft PR. Tokate discovers or creates your fork. Use `--fork`
only when you need to select one explicitly. You do not need to write request JSON.

`--seconds` caps coding plus verification time, not tokens or server billing.
Command network access defaults off. Downloads need both owner permission and
`--allow-network` on the new claim. Inference connectivity is separate. There is no
automatic retry, continuation or model fallback. Review [data and isolation limits](security.md).

## Check progress

Bare `tokate` also offers saved contributions. Inspection works offline and requires
explicit selection. For scripts or a custom run path:

```sh
tokate status --run RUN_DIRECTORY
tokate checks --repo OWNER/REPO --pr 10 --watch
```

Follow the reported next action. Quiet output does not justify restarting work.
Keep the saved directory for [recovery and review changes](recovery.md). The owner
reviews and merges. Older assignment-bound repositories retain their existing
workflow, which can publish from `work`; inspect their policy before starting.
